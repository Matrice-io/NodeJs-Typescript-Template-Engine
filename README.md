The purpose of the project here is to build a minimalist templating-engine using simple Typescript program :)

## ü™∞‚òïÔ∏è Mouchetasse {

1. Install nodejs and npm (included in nodejs distribution) on your machine.

2. Create a new project folder 'mouchetasse', then generate a package.json using the command 'npm init' (don't forget to also generate a repo with 'git init' and commit each step of your work).

3. Install the dependency 'typescript' (don't forget to add a '.gitignore' file containing 'node_modules').
    
4. Create an index.ts file containing an empty function, just for the beginning.
    
5. Compile from typescript to javascript using the typescript compiler (tsc) with: 'npx tsc index.ts'
    
6. You can check if the 'index.js' file generated is correct.
    
7. If it's ok, you can then create a function 'compile' in 'index.ts' to inject some data in an html file.

8. NB: You will have to create a new project folder containing an html file and some data to try this template-engine.
