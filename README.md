The purpose of the project here is to build a minimalist templating-engine using simple Typescript program :)

## 🪰☕️ Mouchetasse {

1. Check that Nodejs and NPM (included in nodejs distribution) are installed on your machine.

2. Create a new project folder 'mouchetasse', then generate a package.json using the command 'npm init' (don't forget to also generate a repo with 'git init' and commit each step of your work 🫵🏻).

3. Install the dependency 'typescript' (when adding dependencies, don't forget to add a '.gitignore' file containing 'node_modules').
    
4. Create an index.ts file containing an empty function, just for the beginning.
    
5. Compile from typescript to javascript using the typescript compiler (tsc) with: 'npx tsc index.ts'.
    
6. You can check if the 'index.js' file generated is correct.

7. Once it's ok, you can then create a function 'compile' in your 'index.ts' file which will **inject some data in an HTML file**.

🏁🏁🏁🏁

8. ...Once done, add a README.md file containing the informations to get started with your library.

9. Don't forget to add the version number of your app in the 'package.json' file.

🏁🏁🏁🏁

10. NB: To try your newly created library, you will have to create another project. (NB: another project which contains an HTML file and some data to try your template-engine).
